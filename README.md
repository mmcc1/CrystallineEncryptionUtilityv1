# Crystalline Encryption Utility v1.0

A basic implementation of the Crystalline Cipher employing the Lattice approach.  Lattice makes use of n number of Keys/Salts to encrypt a file.  Typically, each Key/Salt is used with 10 rounds (11 due to the code) then Key/Salts are switched and the process repeated.  In all, the basic settings use 110 rounds.
